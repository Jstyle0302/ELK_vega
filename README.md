ELK_vega
========
After the released 6.0.0 version or the latter version, Kibana starts to support the vega-plugin in its visualize function. Even more, the Kibana set this function as its basic function after the Kibana6.2.2.     
The vega and vega-lite are advanced functions of Kibana. It can build more complex graphs which cannot be created by the normal graphs. For instance, we can build the Sanky graph, TreeMap graph and the Word Cloud with multiple indexes to filter the result. In this repositories, I put some simple vega and vega-lite codes I used to solve some specific problems and try the vega function. If you want to see more  detailed sample of the vega and vega-lite, you can browse its official website on [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/).

This project records some Kibana Vega and Vega-Lite codes.
